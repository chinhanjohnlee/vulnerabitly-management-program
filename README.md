# Vulnerability Management Program Implementation

In this project, we simulate the implementation of a comprehensive vulnerability management program, from inception to completion.

_**Inception State:**_ the organization has no existing policy or vulnerability management practices in place.

_**Completion State:**_ a formal policy is enacted, stakeholder buy-in is secured, and a full cycle of organization-wide vulnerability remediation is successfully completed.

### Step 2) Mock Meeting: Policy Buy-In (Stakeholders)

In this phase, a meeting with the server team introduces the draft Vulnerability Management Policy and assesses their capability to meet remediation timelines. Feedback leads to adjustments, like extending the critical remediation window from 48 hours to one week, ensuring collaborative implementation.

**Scene:** A brief meeting between Josh and Jimmy regarding a new vulnerability remediation policy.

**Characters:**

*   **Josh:** Represents management/policy creation.
*   **Jimmy:** Represents the IT/operations team.

**(Scene opens with Josh entering Jimmy's office/workspace.)**

**Josh:** "Morning, Jimmy," Josh greeted, walking into the office. "How's everything been recently? I know everyone's been swamped these last few weeks."

**Jimmy:** Jimmy looked up from his computer, a slight weariness in his eyes. "Morning, Josh. Yeah, it's been a bit hectic, to say the least. We're hanging in there, though, thanks for asking. I did have a chance to read through the policy draft, and overall, it makes sense. However, with our current staffing levels, we just can't realistically meet those aggressive remediation timelines, especially the 48-hour window for critical vulnerabilities."

**Josh:** Josh nodded understandingly. "Yeah, I totally get that. It is a bit aggressive, especially to start. I was thinking, perhaps we could extend the critical vulnerability window to one week initially. It might be a good compromise for now. Then, we can reserve the 48-hour window for those truly catastrophic, like, real-deal zero-day vulnerabilities that are actively being exploited."

**Jimmy:** Jimmy leaned back in his chair, considering the suggestion. "A week for critical vulnerabilities is definitely more manageable. That would give us time to properly assess the issue, plan a patch, and implement it without causing unnecessary disruption. The 48-hour window for active zero-days makes sense – those are the ones that require immediate action."

**Jimmy:** He paused, then added, "We also appreciate the flexibility. Would it be possible to have a little bit of leeway in the very beginning, as we work through getting used to the new remediation and patching process? Just for the first few months or so?"

**Josh:** Josh smiled reassuringly. "Absolutely. After the policy is finalized, we'll officially start the program, but we're planning to give all the departments about six months to adjust and get comfortable with the new process and procedures. We understand it's a significant change, and we want to ensure everyone has the time they need to adapt. We can also provide additional training and resources during this period, if needed."

**Jimmy:** "Six months sounds much more reasonable," Jimmy replied, a visible sense of relief washing over him. "That gives us time to not only adjust our workflows but also potentially explore options for automating some of the patching processes, which would help us meet tighter deadlines in the future."

**Josh:** "Exactly," Josh agreed. "We want this to be a sustainable solution, not just a knee-jerk reaction. We're also open to feedback during this initial period. If you encounter any specific challenges or roadblocks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We can then work together to find solutions."

**Jimmy:** Jimmy nodded. "Thanks, Josh. We'll do our best. I really appreciate you including us in the decision-making process. It makes a huge difference and really helps us feel like we're a part of the solution."

**Josh:** "Of course," Josh said warmly. "We're all in this together. We need your expertise and input to make this work effectively. Thanks for working with us on this."

**Jimmy:** "No problem," Jimmy responded. "Thanks for the quick and productive meeting."

**Josh:** "Yeah, those are my favorite kind," Josh chuckled. "Alright, I'll let you get back to it. See you later."

**Jimmy:** "Bye now," Jimmy replied.

**(Scene ends.)**

**Key Takeaways:**

*   This dialogue demonstrates the importance of communication and collaboration between management and technical teams when implementing new policies.
*   Flexibility and a phased rollout can significantly improve the adoption and effectiveness of new security procedures.
*   Openness to feedback and a willingness to adjust based on real-world experience are crucial for long-term success.

### Step 4) Mock Meeting: Initial Scan Permission (Server Team)

The team collaborates with the server team to initiate scheduled credential scans. A compromise is reached to scan a single server first, monitoring resource impact, and using just-in-time Active Directory credentials for secure, controlled access.  

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand the scanning discussion scene</summary>

**Scene:** A meeting between Josh and Jimmy discussing the implementation of vulnerability scans.

**Characters:**

*   **Josh:** Represents management/security concerns.
*   **Jimmy:** Represents the security/IT team responsible for conducting the scans.

**(Scene opens with Josh approaching Jimmy.)**

**Josh:** "Morning, Jimmy," Josh greeted as he approached Jimmy's desk. "Good morning. I heard you're ready to conduct some scans."

**Jimmy:** "Yep," Jimmy replied. "Now that our vulnerability management policy is in place, I wanted to get started on conducting some scheduled credentialed scans of your environment."

**Josh:** "Sounds good to me," Josh said. "What's involved? How can we help?"

**Jimmy:** "We're planning to schedule weekly scans of the server infrastructure," Jimmy explained. "We estimate it'll take about four to six hours to scan all 200 assets. To get the most accurate results, we'll need you to provide us with some administrative credentials. This will allow the scan engine to remotely log into the target systems and perform a more thorough assessment."

**Josh:** Josh's eyebrows furrowed slightly. "Whoa, whoa, hold on there. Can you elaborate on what this scanning actually entails? I'm a bit worried about resource utilization impacting server performance. Also, you're requesting admin credentials to all 200 machines? That doesn't sound very secure."

**Jimmy:** "Those are valid concerns," Jimmy acknowledged. "The scan engine basically sends various network traffic patterns to the servers to check for the presence of known vulnerabilities. This includes things like examining the registry for misconfigurations, checking for outdated software installations, identifying insecure protocols or cipher suites, and looking for known vulnerabilities in running services. That's why credentials are required – to allow the scanner to access the necessary information on the systems."

**Josh:** Josh leaned back in his chair, thinking. "I see. So, it's actively probing the systems. As long as it doesn't bring the servers offline, I guess we should be okay. But I'm still concerned about the potential performance impact, especially during peak hours."

**Jimmy:** "Absolutely," Jimmy reassured him. "To address that, let's start with a test scan. We'll scan a single representative server first and closely monitor its resource utilization – CPU, memory, network bandwidth, disk I/O – during the scan. This will give us a baseline and allow us to fine-tune the scan configuration to minimize any impact on production systems."

**Josh:** "That's a good idea," Josh agreed. "A pilot scan will definitely help alleviate my concerns. Now, about the credentials… giving out domain admin credentials to a scanning tool for all our servers is a major security risk. Is there a more secure approach?"

**Jimmy:** "Yes, there is," Jimmy confirmed. "Instead of giving us permanent domain admin access, we can implement a just-in-time access approach using Active Directory. You could set up a dedicated service account in Active Directory with the necessary local administrator privileges on the target servers. This account would remain disabled by default. When we're ready to perform a scan, you can enable the account for the duration of the scan, and then immediately disable or even deprovision it afterward. This significantly reduces the window of opportunity for any potential misuse of the credentials."

**Josh:** "That sounds much better," Josh said, visibly relieved. "That way, the credentials are only active when absolutely necessary. It's a much more secure and controlled approach. I'll ask Susan in our security team to get started on automating the account provisioning and deprovisioning process. We can use PowerShell or other scripting tools to handle the enabling and disabling of the account."

**Jimmy:** "Awesome," Jimmy said. "That would be perfect. Automating the process will ensure consistency and reduce the chance of human error. It will also make the process more efficient."

**Josh:** "Okay," Josh said, standing up. "I'll talk to Susan right away and get the ball rolling. I'll get back to you once the credentials and automation are set up."

**Jimmy:** "Great," Jimmy replied. "Sounds good. I'll be ready to run the test scan as soon as you are. See you later."

**Josh:** "See you later," Josh responded, heading out.

**(Scene ends.)**

**Key Takeaways:**

*   This dialogue highlights the importance of balancing security needs with operational requirements.
*   It demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing security concerns by implementing a pilot scan and just-in-time access for credentials.
*   The discussion emphasizes the value of communication and collaboration between different teams (security and IT operations).

### Step 6) Vulnerability Assessment and Prioritization

We assessed vulnerabilities and established a remediation prioritization strategy based on ease of remediation and impact. The following priorities were set:

1. Third Party Software Removal (Wireshark)
2. Windows OS Secure Configuration (Protocols & Ciphers)
3. Windows OS Secure Configuration (Guest Account Group Membership)
4. Windows OS Updates

---

### Step 7) Distributing Remediations to Remediation Teams

The server team received remediation scripts and scan reports to address key vulnerabilities. This streamlined their efforts and prepared them for a follow-up review.

### Step 8) Mock Meeting: Post-Initial Discovery Scan (Server Team)

The server team reviewed vulnerability scan results, identifying outdated software, insecure accounts, and deprecated protocols. The remediation packages were prepared for submission to the Change Control Board (CAB). 

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand the scan results discussion scene</summary>

**Scene:** A follow-up meeting between Josh and Jimmy to discuss the results of a vulnerability scan.

**Characters:**

*   **Josh:** Represents the security/IT team, presenting the scan results.
*   **Jimmy:** Represents the system administration team, responsible for remediation.

**(Scene opens with Josh and Jimmy meeting, Josh sharing his screen.)**

**Josh:** "Morning, Jimmy," Josh greeted. "How are you doing?"

**Jimmy:** "Not bad for a Monday," Jimmy replied. "And yourself?"

**Josh:** "I'm still alive, so I can't complain," Josh chuckled. "But before we get into the vulnerability findings, how did the actual scan go on your end? Did you have any outages, overutilization, or anything like that?"

**Jimmy:** "The scan went well," Jimmy reported. "We were closely monitoring the servers during the process, and aside from the expected increase in open network connections, we wouldn't have even known a scan was taking place. There was no noticeable performance impact."

**Josh:** "Yeah, that's good news," Josh said. "I kind of expected as much, given the pilot scan we ran. We can continue monitoring going forward, but I don't anticipate any issues with resource utilization. Do you mind if I dive into the vulnerability findings now?"

**Jimmy:** "Yeah, absolutely," Jimmy confirmed.

**Josh:** "Cool," Josh said. "I'm going to share my screen real quick." *(Josh shares his screen)* "So, basically, the majority of these vulnerabilities stem from an outdated installation of Wireshark. You can see a number of findings related to Wireshark because it's just severely out of date. That's the primary issue there."

**Josh:** "One interesting thing I did find," Josh continued, "is that the local guest account on several servers actually belongs to a group, and when I looked deeper, it turns out it's a member of the local administrators group. I'm not sure why that is, but it's definitely a security concern."

**Josh:** "Also," Josh added, "some of these vulnerabilities, like this Microsoft Edge Chromium one, and possibly this other one as well, might be automatically resolved by Windows Updates. I'm not entirely sure about the second one, but we can verify that later. We also have a finding related to a self-signed certificate, but we don't have to worry about that one since it's just the computer's default self-signed certificate used for internal communication."

**Josh:** "However," Josh emphasized, "these medium-strength cipher suites and the use of deprecated TLS 1.0 and 1.1 protocols are something we should definitely take some time to remediate. These are considered deprecated and insecure, so we need to address them."

**Josh:** "So, to summarize," Josh concluded, "we're primarily looking at remediating the outdated Wireshark installations, removing the guest account from the local administrators group, and addressing the deprecated cipher suites and protocols."

**Jimmy:** "Very interesting," Jimmy commented. "The good news is, I suspect most of our servers are going to have the same vulnerabilities. Hopefully, that makes things easier during remediation. A uniform set of issues is easier to handle than a completely different set on each server."

**Josh:** "Yeah, that's actually good news," Josh agreed. "Like a uniform loadout, as you said. Do you foresee any issues with remediating any of these specifically, like the cipher suites and the insecure protocols?"

**Jimmy:** "I highly doubt there will be any issues," Jimmy responded. "We'll run the changes through the next Change Control Board, of course, but uninstalling Wireshark and fixing the guest account permissions shouldn't be a problem at all. Those applications and configurations aren't supposed to be on the servers in the first place. I'll have to talk to our system administrators about how the guest account got those permissions."

**Josh:** "That's good news," Josh said. "I'll go ahead and get started on building out some remediation packages for you to kind of make your life easier when it comes time to fix them. That way, you'll have pre-tested scripts and procedures ready to go."

**Jimmy:** "That sounds great," Jimmy replied. "Oh, I wanted to ask, do you have anything in place to actually address the Windows Update-related vulnerabilities? Do you have a patch management system already?"

**Jimmy:** "Oh, yes," Jimmy confirmed. "I'm not actually worried about those. Windows Updates should be handled automatically by next week through our existing patch management infrastructure."

**Josh:** "Okay, excellent," Josh said. "All right, I'll get started on researching the best way to remediate these findings, focusing on the cipher suites and protocols, and I'll get back to you before the next Change Control Board meeting."

**Jimmy:** "Sounds good," Jimmy replied. "Talk to you soon."

**Josh:** "Cool, cool. Talk to you soon," Josh echoed.

**(Scene ends.)**

**Key Takeaways:**

*   This dialogue demonstrates the process of reviewing vulnerability scan results and planning remediation efforts.
*   It highlights the importance of prioritizing vulnerabilities based on risk and impact.
*   The discussion emphasizes the value of collaboration between security and system administration teams.

### Step 9) Mock CAB Meeting: Implementing Remediations

The Change Control Board (CAB) reviewed and approved the plan to remove insecure protocols and cipher suites. The plan included a rollback script and a tiered deployment approach.  

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand the scan results discussion scene</summary>

**Scene:** A follow-up meeting between Josh and Jimmy to discuss the results of a vulnerability scan.

**Characters:**

*   **Josh:** Represents the security/IT team, presenting the scan results.
*   **Jimmy:** Represents the system administration team, responsible for remediation.

**(Scene opens with Josh and Jimmy meeting, Josh sharing his screen.)**

**Josh:** "Morning, Jimmy," Josh greeted. "How are you doing?"

**Jimmy:** "Not bad for a Monday," Jimmy replied. "And yourself?"

**Josh:** "I'm still alive, so I can't complain," Josh chuckled. "But before we get into the vulnerability findings, how did the actual scan go on your end? Did you experience any outages, overutilization, or any other unexpected issues?"

**Jimmy:** "The scan went smoothly," Jimmy reported. "We were actively monitoring the servers throughout the process, and aside from the expected increase in open network connections during the scan periods, there was no noticeable performance impact. We wouldn't have even known a scan was taking place if we hadn't been watching."

**Josh:** "Yeah, that's good news," Josh said. "I was cautiously optimistic, given the successful pilot scan we conducted earlier. We can continue our monitoring efforts going forward, but I don't anticipate encountering any significant resource utilization problems. Do you mind if I dive into the vulnerability findings now?"

**Jimmy:** "Yeah, absolutely," Jimmy confirmed.

**Josh:** "Cool," Josh said. "I'm going to share my screen real quick." *(Josh shares his screen, displaying the vulnerability scan results.)* "So, as you can see, the majority of the identified vulnerabilities stem from an outdated installation of Wireshark. We have multiple findings related to Wireshark, all pointing to the fact that the installed version is severely out of date. That's the primary source of our vulnerabilities in this scan."

**Josh:** "One particularly interesting finding," Josh continued, "is that the local guest account on several servers actually belongs to a group. Upon further investigation, I discovered that this group is a member of the local administrators group. I'm not sure how that configuration occurred, but it's a significant security concern, as it grants excessive privileges to the guest account."

**Josh:** "Additionally," Josh added, "some of these vulnerabilities, such as the finding related to Microsoft Edge Chromium, and potentially another one as well, might be automatically resolved by our regularly scheduled Windows Updates. I'm not completely certain about that second one, so we'll need to confirm that separately. We also have a finding related to a self-signed certificate, but as it's the computer's default self-signed certificate used for internal, non-public-facing communication, we don't need to prioritize remediation for that one."

**Josh:** "However," Josh emphasized, "we do need to address the findings related to medium-strength cipher suites and the use of deprecated TLS 1.0 and 1.1 protocols. These are considered deprecated and insecure, and their continued use increases our attack surface. We should prioritize remediating these."

**Josh:** "So, to summarize the key findings," Josh concluded, "we're primarily focusing on remediating the outdated Wireshark installations, removing the guest account from the local administrators group, and addressing the deprecated cipher suites and TLS protocols."

**Jimmy:** "Very interesting," Jimmy commented. "The good news is, I suspect most, if not all, of our servers are likely to have the same set of vulnerabilities. This uniformity should simplify the remediation process considerably. A consistent set of issues across the infrastructure is much easier to manage than dealing with unique problems on each server."

**Josh:** "Yeah, that's actually good news," Josh agreed. "A consistent configuration, as you put it. Do you foresee any specific challenges or roadblocks with remediating any of these findings, particularly the cipher suites and the insecure protocols?"

**Jimmy:** "I highly doubt there will be any significant issues," Jimmy responded. "We'll, of course, run all proposed changes through the next Change Control Board for formal approval, but uninstalling Wireshark and correcting the guest account's group membership should be straightforward. Those are misconfigurations that shouldn't exist in the first place. I'll have to follow up with our system administrators to determine how the guest account gained those elevated permissions."

**Josh:** "That's good to hear," Josh said. "I'll go ahead and start developing some remediation packages to streamline the process for you. These packages will include pre-tested scripts and documented procedures to make the remediation process as efficient and error-free as possible."

**Jimmy:** "That sounds excellent," Jimmy replied. "Oh, I wanted to ask—do you have any existing mechanisms in place to address the Windows Update-related vulnerabilities? Do you have a patch management system deployed?"

**Jimmy:** "Oh, yes," Jimmy confirmed. "I'm not concerned about those particular findings. Windows Updates are managed automatically through our established patch management infrastructure, and those vulnerabilities should be resolved by next week's scheduled patching cycle."

**Josh:** "Okay, excellent," Josh said. "All right, I'll get started on researching the best approach to remediate the remaining findings, with a particular focus on the cipher suites and protocols. I'll get back to you with the remediation packages and proposed changes before the next Change Control Board meeting."

**Jimmy:** "Sounds good," Jimmy replied. "Talk to you soon."

**Josh:** "Cool, cool. Talk to you soon," Josh echoed.

**(Scene ends.)**

**Key Takeaways:**

*   This dialogue demonstrates the process of reviewing vulnerability scan results and planning remediation efforts.
*   It highlights the importance of prioritizing vulnerabilities based on risk and impact (e.g., focusing on deprecated protocols and unauthorized account permissions).
*   The discussion emphasizes the value of collaboration between security and system administration teams.
*   It also shows the importance of having existing processes in place, like patch management.

---

### On-going Vulnerability Management (Maintenance Mode)

After completing the initial remediation cycle, the vulnerability management program transitions into **Maintenance Mode**. This phase ensures that vulnerabilities continue to be managed proactively, keeping systems secure over time. Regular scans, continuous monitoring, and timely remediation are crucial components of this phase. (See [Finalized Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rvueLX_71pOR8ldN9zVW9r_zLzDQxVsnSUtNar8ftdg/edit?usp=drive_link) for scanning and remediation cadence requirements.)

Key activities in Maintenance Mode include:
- **Scheduled Vulnerability Scans**: Perform regular scans (e.g., weekly or monthly) to detect new vulnerabilities as systems evolve.
- **Patch Management**: Continuously apply security patches and updates, ensuring no critical vulnerabilities remain unpatched.
- **Remediation Follow-ups**: Address newly identified vulnerabilities promptly, prioritizing based on risk and impact.
- **Policy Review and Updates**: Periodically review the Vulnerability Management Policy to ensure it aligns with the latest security best practices and organizational needs.
- **Audit and Compliance**: Conduct internal audits to ensure compliance with the vulnerability management policy and external regulations.
- **Ongoing Communication with Stakeholders**: Maintain open communication with teams responsible for remediation, ensuring efficient coordination.

By maintaining an active vulnerability management process, organizations can stay ahead of emerging threats and ensure long-term security resilience.
